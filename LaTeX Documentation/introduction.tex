    \item The car should have a display that shows the state of the car.

    \item The car should have a horn that can be activated by a button.
    \item The car should have a brake that can be activated by a button.
\end{itemize}For the assignment I had to use the IoT KIT given to me which included these parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A lightâ€“dependent resistor (LDR).
    \item A DIP switch (DIP).
    \item A DC motor (MOT).
    \item An L293D motor driver (DRV).
    \item A potentiometer (POT).
    \item An I2C SSD1306 OLED display (DSP).
    \item A Hall effect sensor (HAL).
    \item A cube magnet (MGN).
    \item A buzzer (BZR).
    \item Auxiliary LEDs (LED).
    \item Auxiliary push buttons (BTN).
\end{itemize}
