Figuring out how to use the motor was the most difficult part of this project. I had never worked with a dc motor before.\\
It also took me a while before I finally settled on a way to implement some kind of core loop without blocking code.\\
I'm happy with the result, it looks clean, works pretty well and I learned a lot from it.
